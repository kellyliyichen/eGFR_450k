The dataset here is only for demonstrating the input format and should not be used for running.

### meth_eg.txt
Methylation level matrix.

Each row is a CpG site; each column is a sample.

### sample_eg.csv
Sample annotations, containing the covariates.

Each row is a sample; each column is a variable. Real dataset should contain more variables (i.e., at least the target variables and covariates).
